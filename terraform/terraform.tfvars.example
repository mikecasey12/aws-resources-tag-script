#############################################################################

# OPTION 1: Let Terraform create new subnets and security group (Recommended)
# Uncomment the following lines to create new network resources:
# 
# vpc_id = "vpc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # REQUIRED if you don't have a default VPC
#                                    # Optional if default VPC exists
# subnet_count = 2                  # Number of subnets to create (default: 2)
#
# IMPORTANT: If your AWS account has no default VPC, you MUST specify vpc_id

# OPTION 2: Use existing subnets and security group
# Uncomment and fill in the following if you have existing network resources:
# existing_private_subnets = [
#   "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
#   "subnet-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
# ]
# existing_ecs_sg_id = "sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# DEPRECATED (for backward compatibility only):
# If you're using old variable names, these will still work:
# private_subnets = ["subnet-xxx", "subnet-xxx"]
# ecs_sg_id = "sg-xxx"
